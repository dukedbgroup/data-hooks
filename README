This repository is used in conjunction with BigFrame (https://github.com/bigframeteam/BigFrame). It collects performance metrics from big data analytics systems by running BigFrame workflows. Additionally it runs a semantic analysis on queries to collect additional data useful for system optimization. Data is stored in a MySQL database.

To run,
1. Build assembly file using sbt/sbt assembly.
2. Copy the generated assembly jar into BigFrame's workflows/lib folder.
3. Run any BigFrame workflow.

Note: Currently only 'thoth' branch of BigFrame supports data collection. So please switch to this branch before Step 2.
