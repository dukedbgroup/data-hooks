To compile:
  1. Make sure you have scala 2.9.2 and sbt installed http://www.scala-sbt.org/
  2. In the base directory run sbt clean package
  3. This will compile and create sparkqueriesplanner_2.9.2-1.0.jar file in target/scala-2.9.2

To run:
  1. Copy sparkqueriesplanner_2.9.2-1.0.jar in your Spark Master node's /root directory
  2. Log in to the Spark Master node and go to the base directory of the spark installation (e.g., /usr/local/spark)
  3. In the spark base directory run the following: export SPARK_CLASSPATH=/root/sparkqueriesplanner_2.9.2-1.0.jar; ./run -Dspark.cluster.taskscheduler=spark.scheduler.cluster.FairTaskSetQueuesManager -Dspark.fairscheduler.allocation.file=/root/alloc.xml -Dspark.storage.memoryFraction=.5 -Dspark.fairscheduler.fairness.logfile=/root/fairnesslog.txt edu.duke.dbmsplus.SparkQueriesPlannerDriver <program parameters> (run it without any param to printout the help)
     3.a. The above command assumes that you are using our version of spark that has fair scheduler
     3.b. The -D parameters are for setting the fairness scheduler in Spark
     3.c. alloc.xml is an xml file for specifying the queues properties in the spark internal fair scheduler (a sample alloc.xml file is included in the sample directory)

To Import into eclipse:
  1. Ensure that your eclipse has the scala plugin installed (search for Scala IDE 2.1.0 Milestone 3)
  2. In Eclipse add a new project (File -> New Project -> Java Project -> Location -> Choose the path to SparkQueriesPlanner)
